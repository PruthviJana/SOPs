📝 **Step-by-Step Guide: Setting up Master-Slave Architecture in Jenkins**

To set up a Master-Slave architecture in Jenkins, follow the steps below:

**On the Jenkins Master:**

1. Jenkins is installed in MasterInstance 

2. Launch other 2 instances(slave 1 ,slave 2)

   // install java in slave1 and slave2 // 
      --  amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y

  ##need to connect Master and slaves

  // to secure our master-slave configuration ,In master-console,,, //  
     --  vim /etc/passwd   
              to check ,its status :cat /etc/passwd

              (at last line , rewrite bin/false to bin/bash) 
               need to set password to connect( give password)

  //giving root previliges to jenkins)
      --  visudo
             yypp there edit the 2nd root line,, jenkins all=(all) NOPASSWD:ALL   wq! back to console

  //Connecting shell to console
      *sshid server 

      --  vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config   ,insert i

             there in password ,make it as yes ... wq! back to consle

      -- systemctl restart sshd
      --systemctl status sshd

//now in slave 1 and slave 2,type 

*useradd jenkins
*passwd jenkins

enter password 
Go with same steps as in master console
editing part

Master instance 

--  su - jenkins   switching to jenkins

ssh-keygen    press enter
ssh-copy-id jenkins@localhost
enter master password  

displays command link ,copy that link and paste then its gets connected to local host 
hostname -i   to check whther we r in master

exit ,for loggin out

copy public ip address of slave1

ssh-copy-id jenkins@(paste public ip address here)


now checking whetehr slave is connected or 
hostname -i (it shows pvt ip address of slave 1

now connecting slave 2

ssh-copy-id jenkins@(paste ublic ip address of slave 2)
it asks for password (enter the password v created)

type hostname -i ,it shows pvt ip of slave 2

*************************  this is Master-slave config  ***********************


Congratulations! You have successfully set up a Master-Slave architecture in Jenkins. The slave node is now connected to the Jenkins master, and you can utilize it for distributed builds and other tasks.
